# Senior DevOps Engineer – FTSE100 – CI/CD focus - £75,000 
Media/Publishing – Holborn

# Stack: 
AWS, Cloudformation, Linux (CentOS), Teamcity, Puppet & Ansible for config, Bash and Python primary languages for scripting, Node.js, MongoDB, ELK stack, Nagios, exploring Terraform, Lambda (test and dev), Docker (some prod). 

# The company: 
Media/Publishing arm of a FTSE 100. Don’t let the FTSE 100 foo you into thinking “big company, big process, lots of red tape”, quite the opposite. As an independent arm of the group, this organisation has the funding of a FTSE100 but the freedom and culture of a much smaller, agile media company. 

# The culture: 
Kind of touched on this above but effectively a very relaxed high-performance environment. All levels of engineering are encouraged to bring ideas to the table. Last year a grads POC made it to production. Real opportunity to learn here and have an impact quickly. They look after their employees – work life balance is always front of mind. Easy to say huh? I think there 29 days holiday + 2 charity days a year is a good initial indicator, along with flexi hours 😊 

# The role: 
A core focus on continuous integration and delivery. You will be part of a truly proactive technology team built on the ethos of continuous improvement. By “truly” I really mean it, you won’t be bogged down with mundane support work, or endless firefighting. This role will work closely with the development and platform teams to help enable them and design more efficient and slick delivery pipeline. 

# What experience is required?
* Lots of experience working with dev and product teams to 1. Understand the end goal and 2. Build CI/CD pipelines to help them deliver faster, more robust, higher quality software/products. 
* Strong AWS experience is a must. 
* This is a heavy CentOS environment but experience with any Linux flavour will be considered. 
* Keeping a finger on the pulse for emerging technologies is key.  
* Experience with as much of the above stack as possible. And a want to learn the rest quickly 😊
